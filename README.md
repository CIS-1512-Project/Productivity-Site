# Introduction
We are Group 3, working on Productivity Site.

Our website aims to be useful for those who need additional help keeping themselves organized and on track. 

With online classes becoming increasingly common since the pandemic, more and more students are struggling to keep themselves organized; however, this site is _not_ only aimed toward students. Even those already well-experienced in their career can fall behind or regularly struggle to keep up with their workload. 
Our web app seeks to aid those wishing to be productive in a user-friendly fashion.

# Productivity Site GitHub
Group 3's Project repository makes cooperation easier, speeding up our development process.

## Repository Structure
The `main` branch will hold our completed app. 
`develop` is for the developmental builds of our app.

Any other branch is a build being actively developed and will be merged with `develop` upon completion.

## Group Structure
Group 3 is comprised of 4 members who individually contribute to the project. All of us have prior experience with web development, which brought us to the conclusion that GitHub would make the process more friendly toward cooperation.
